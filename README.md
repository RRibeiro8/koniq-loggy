# Blind Image Quality Assessment with DeepLearning: a Replicability Study and its Reproducibility in Lifelogging

This work is a replicability study of best model of the paper ["KonIQ-10k: An Ecologically Valid Database for Deep Learning of Blind Image Quality Assessment"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.06180.pdf) and its reproducibility in a lifelogging dataset.

The [koniq](koniq/) folder is the [KonIQ-10k](https://github.com/subpic/koniq) original code repository and the [ku](ku/) folder is the [Keras Utilities](https://github.com/subpic/ku) library provided by the author of the original repository. (Note that some changes have been made to this library files to update some libraries to newer versions.)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8
